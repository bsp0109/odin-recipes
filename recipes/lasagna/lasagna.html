  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ground beef (1 lb)</li>
    <li>Canned crushed tomatoes (28 oz)</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Garlic (3 cloves)</li>
    <li>Basil (1 tsp dried)</li>
    <li>Oregano (1 tsp dried)</li>
    <li>Ricotta cheese (15 oz)</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese (1 cup shredded)</li>
    <li>Large eggs</li>
    <li>Parsley (chopped, for garnish)</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese (shredded, for serving)</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles (12-16 sheets)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Tomato Sauce</strong>: Brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high
      heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Add garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to taste, and
      cook for an additional minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer the Tomato Sauce</strong>: Stir in the canned crushed tomatoes, olive oil, and a pinch of
      salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the
      sauce has thickened and reduced slightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture</strong>: In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese,
      eggs, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong>: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a layer of tomato sauce on
      the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 4-6 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, followed by half of the
      ricotta mixture and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat the Layers</strong>: Repeat steps 4, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.
      Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna</strong>: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until
      the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy!</strong>: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
      Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.</li>
  </ol>
